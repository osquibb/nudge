# Nudge

A currently aimless project which I'm using to brush up on ReactJs Hooks, ExpressJs, PassportJs, KnexJs and any other technologies that I find interesting.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run server`

Runs the express server in the development mode on http://localhost:5000

The server will reload if you make edits (using nodemon).\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run client`

Runs the react app in the development mode on http://localhost:3000
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
